# lemonpi-codetask

I used my own react boilerplate for this to save time.
Normally for a simple task like this one would not have to use Redux.
But my boilerplate is designed for complex frontend applications.
This example shows how the app handles data and we can build on to add more complexity.

It was not possible to finish everything in the limited time I had:

- Error handling is unfinished. I've only added the page notification elements, but didn't have time to add the error handling functionality.
- I didn't have the time to do the last exercise 6, which was about configuring/saving the sorting through the url.
- Normally I would add validation on the content of the response to the api requests to make sure the right response is coming back.
